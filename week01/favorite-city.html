    <h1>San Salvador</h1>
    <p>San Salvador is a place full of life and lots of people like to visit its historical downtown buildings. I really enjoy the
        amazing views you can get during the night.
    </p>
    <p>Another thing you can do is to enter the historical building where our independence was first planned. If you have 5 dollars,
        you might as well get some good lunch or some delicious snacks. I hope you can enjoy.
